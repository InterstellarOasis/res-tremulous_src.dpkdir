TREMULOUS SUPPORT FILES FOR RADIANT

    This archive contains the necessary support files to use the Radiant
    map editor to create Tremulous maps. It does not include the gamepack
    for Radiant itself.

    The textures in the common/ and radiant/ subdirectories replace
    those found in common-spog.pk3 and can be used freely.

    The common.shader file has been floating around in the community for a while,
    I cleaned it up a bit to match the new textures.

    The models and related textures were extracted from common-strands.pk3 and
    common-mgturret.pk3.

INSTALLATION

    This file should be copied into the Tremulous base/ directory.
    This is the directory that contains the main data-1.1.0.pk3.

    If it doesn't exists, create a new subdirectory scripts/ inside
    the base/ directory. In this subdirectory, there should be a file
    called shaderlist.txt with the following content:

	arachnid2
	atcs
	karith
	nexus6
	niveus
	transit
	tremor
	uncreation
	common
	common-trem
	titan
	displays
	misc
	plant_life
	water
