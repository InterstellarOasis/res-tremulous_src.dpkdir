Acknowledgements
Godmil: thanks to Crimity, Roughrider, Myth (for help with plant shaders).  Kat
for pointing out that I should use more phong shaders.  Timbo, Overflow,
Stannum, Jex, Jhrx, MoP and everyone who worked on Tremulous, for help,
encouragement, and  listening to me bitching about bugs :) Veda for letting
me remake his map, Lava Croft and Molog for helping beta test.  Lifer and Jex
for teaching me how to map.  and most of all Who-[Soup] for betting me that I
couldn't make this into a playable map in less than a week :D (also a wee
shoutout to everyone in the Gloom and Tremulous communities,
www.Map-center.com, the Trem Dev Team, and  my clan mates in MaF <3 )
