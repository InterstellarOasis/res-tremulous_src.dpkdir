		======================

This is a map for Tremulous (http://tremulous.net/).



The map has 8456 brushes (including patches), and took entirely too long to
make. 

   BSP: 172 seconds
   VIS: 12  seconds
 LIGHT: 732 seconds

	A note on the doors:

There are a total of four doors in this map, two in the human half, and another
two in the alien half. They are set to open at different stages during the
game. The door closest to the alien base, and the door on the alien side in the
central hub room are triggered by the alien team's stage advances (Stage 2 and
3, respectively). The same goes for the doors on the human team. 

	Thanks go to:

The entire dev team of Tremulous for helping me finish this map (especially
Timbo for coding various things into Tremulous just for my map, Godmil for
providing various mapping information while I shouted at him, and Jex for doing
the same while I didn't shout at him.)

Most of the textures have been taken from Lunaran's lun3dm4, and from Sock's
tech1soc texture set. Without those textures, this map would not be able to
exist. Thanks.
